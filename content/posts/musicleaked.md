## **The Producers Nightmare**

&nbsp;

You send a beat pack to a rapper. You email a demo to a label A/R rep. Two weeks later, you hear your melody on the radio—or find your unreleased track leaked on a forum.

&nbsp;

Music collaboration relies on sharing files, but sharing files usually means losing control. Once that MP3 leaves your email, it's gone. To survive in the modern music industry, you need a way to share your art without surrendering your rights.

&nbsp;

## **Media Seal: The Digital Lock for Your Audio**

Media Seal was built to solve the "Demo Problem." It creates a unique seal containing your identity info which is algorithmically embedded into the file, allowing you to share music with collaborators while maintaining total control.

&nbsp;


### **1. Flexible Custom Metadata: The Embedded Split Sheet**
The biggest cause of music lawsuits is "who wrote what?" Text messages and emails get lost. Media Seal allows you to embed Flexible Custom Metadata directly into the audio file structure. You can include:

&nbsp;


* **Split percentages** (e.g., "50% Producer / 50% Writer")
* **Contact information** for clearance.
* **"Demo Use Only"** restrictions.

&nbsp;


This metadata travels with the file, ensuring that anyone who opens it knows exactly who owns it and how to pay them.

&nbsp;

### **2. Targeted Signing: Tracking the Source of the Leak**
One of the most powerful features of Media Seal is the ability to create unique signatures for specific recipients. Before sending a demo to a label executive or a potential collaborator, you can sign that specific copy with their name or a unique identifier in the metadata.

&nbsp;


If that file later appears on a leak site or file-sharing forum, you don't just know what leaked—you know who leaked it. The embedded signature points directly back to the person who received that specific copy.

### **3. Proof of Ownership**
If a label steals your demo and claims they wrote it, Media Seal provides indisputable Proof of Ownership. Your digital signature is timestamped and embedded. You can prove, mathematically, that you possessed the original file before they did.

&nbsp;

### **4. Authenticity in an AI World**
With AI music generators flooding streaming services, proving human authorship is becoming harder. A Media Seal signature proves that your track is an authentic project file from your studio, not a generated loop.

&nbsp;

### **5. Tamper Proof Security**
If a collaborator takes your track and tries to edit out your producer tag or alter the mix, the Media Seal integrity check will fail. You will have definitive proof that the file was altered from its original state.

&nbsp;

**Don't Stop Collaborating. Start Sealing.**

You don't have to hoard your music to keep it safe. You just need to seal it. Send your demos with confidence, knowing your identity is embedded in every beat.
